## Thoughts

- distinguish between circles and crosses
- show actual data (e.g., .csv)
- add info overlay on hover
- would this be better using pure html?
	- the size of the calendar could be dynamic (e.g., filling the screen)
	- each box could have data attributes like month/day/count/etc
	- getting object we're hovering/clicking on would be more natural


## Notes

- when exporting .ai to .png, make sure you check 'Use Artboards' or else it will crop the borders of the image, messing up the sprite grid
